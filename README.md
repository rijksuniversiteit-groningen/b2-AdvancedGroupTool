# Advanced Group Tool
The Advanced Group Tool can be used instead of the default Groups tool in Blackboard. The AGT allows instructors to quickly create and manage a large number of groups. Students can either sign up for groups themselves, or the AGT can divide students into each group. Furthermore, import and export functionality is provided.

This building block requires a license key. Please contact Nestorsupport (nestorsupport@rug.nl) for any questions.
